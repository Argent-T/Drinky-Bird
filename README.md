## Description
Drinky bird is a site which allows users to search for cocktail recipes by name, first letter, and by main ingredient. It also provides local bar locations, descriptions, and ratings wherein the user can order the drinks they choose.


## User Story
Given that I am a Cocktail Enthusiast, 
I want to be able to search for cocktail recipes using multiple different search methods, 
and to be able to locate bars within which I can order them. 

## Credits
As a group we were able to use these resources for our project: https://materializecss.com/, https://developers.zomato.com/api, https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php, and https://www.w3schools.com/. Also special recognition goes to the help of our TAs/Instructor that were able to help us on creating such a dynamic product.
