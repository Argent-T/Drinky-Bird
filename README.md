# Project-1


## Description
I was able to build a weather dashboard application with search functionality to find current weather conditions for multiple cities. You are able to key a city in the search bar and it will display and append other searches.

## Business Context
Using this application will be great for our consumers to be able to see cocktails with detail instructions. Also having a bar search to display local bars where they are that will show ratings, etc.




## Credits
As a group we were able to use these resources for our project: https://materializecss.com/, https://developers.zomato.com/api, https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php, and https://www.w3schools.com/. Also special recognition goes to the help of our TAs/Instructor that were able to help us on creating such a dynamic product.
